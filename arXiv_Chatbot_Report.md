# 📄 Project Report: arXiv Chatbot

**Project Name:** arXiv Chatbot  
**Developer:** Adham Ansari  
**Repository:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/KeSi-AN/arVix-Chatbot)

---

## ✅ Overview

The **arXiv Chatbot** is an intelligent assistant designed to help users query, summarize, and discuss scientific research papers sourced from the arXiv preprint archive. The chatbot allows users to enter natural language queries about topics or specific papers, and it responds with contextually relevant, concise answers.

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Allow users to search arXiv papers through a conversational interface.
- Summarize scientific content into easy-to-understand language.
- Improve accessibility to research using NLP-driven summarization.
- Support keyword search, title filtering, and abstract comprehension.

## ✅ Tools & Technologies Used

| Category          | Stack                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Language          | Python                                    |
| Framework         | LangChain (assumed), Streamlit / Gradio (UI) |
| Data Source       | arXiv API                                 |
| NLP Models        | OpenAI GPT-3.5/4, HuggingFace Transformers |
| Libraries         | `requests`, `openai`, `arxiv`, `streamlit`, `langchain` |

## ✅ Key Features

- **Natural Language Interface**: Users can ask complex scientific questions or request summaries.
- **arXiv Integration**: Real-time search and fetch of abstracts, metadata, and links from arXiv.
- **Text Summarization**: AI-generated summaries for dense abstracts or full papers.
- **Interactive UI**: Likely built with Streamlit or Gradio for ease of access.

## ✅ System Architecture

```plaintext
User Input → NLP Query Parsing → arXiv API Fetch → LLM-based Processing → Summary / Response
```

- Handles both question answering and summarization
- Leverages a retriever-augmented generation (RAG) architecture if LangChain is used

---

## ✅ Possible Improvements

- Support for PDF parsing and full paper ingestion
- Answer grounding with paper citations
- Offline caching for frequent queries
- Visualization of paper metadata (e.g., author networks, topics)

## ✅ Conclusion

This project showcases how conversational AI can improve scientific information retrieval and engagement. By combining arXiv’s open research access with modern NLP techniques, the arXiv Chatbot enhances how users explore academic content.

---

## ✅ Future Work

- Add support for audio Q&A (voice input/output)
- Build a citation recommendation engine
- Fine-tune summarization for scientific domains (e.g., math vs. bio)

## 🔐 Kaggle API Key Notice

**Important:** For security reasons, the `kaggle.json` file (Kaggle API credentials) is **not included** in this repository.

To run the training notebook, please follow these steps:

1. Go to your [Kaggle account settings](https://www.kaggle.com/settings).
2. Scroll down to the **API section** and click on **"Create New API Token"**.
3. This will download a file called `kaggle.json`.
4. Place `kaggle.json` in the **root directory** of the project.

The training notebook will automatically use this file to download datasets securely.

**Do NOT share your `kaggle.json` publicly or commit it to GitHub.**
